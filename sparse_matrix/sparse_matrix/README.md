# Sparse Matrix Operations

## Overview

This project delivers an innovative Python-based solution for efficient sparse matrix operations, leveraging a dictionary of dictionaries (DoD) data structure to minimize memory usage while maintaining flexibility and speed. Unlike traditional dense matrix representations, this approach focuses on sparse matrices, where the majority of elements are zeros, ensuring that only non-zero entries are stored and processed.
